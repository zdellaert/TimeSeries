# Sampling instructions at each timepoint:

## Supplies Needed

1. Gloves
2. LN2-handling cryogloves
3. Dewar containing LN2 and mesh bag
4. 5 mL tube rack
5. 1.5 mL tube rack
6. Clippers
7. Forceps
8. 70% ethanol and DI bottles for cleaning tools
9. Kimwipes/paper towels
10. Waste container for plugs
11. Lab coats
12. Secondary containment bin for tube rack containing fixative tubes
13. Clipboards, pens, sharpies for data recording

## Sampling workflow:

0. Ensure all necessary tubes and whirlpaks are labelled
   1. 6 5mL tubes containing PAXgene Tissue fixative labeled Spp_R#_C1-C3 & Spp_R#_H1-H3
   2. 6 5mL tubes containing 4 % Formaldehyde in Seawater (formalin) labeled Spp_S#_C1-C3 & Spp_S#_H1-H3
   3. 6 2mL tubes containing DNA/RNA shield labeled Spp_R#_C1-C3 & Spp_R#_H1-H3
   4. 6 whirlpaks labeled Spp_P#_C1-C3 & Spp_P#_H1-H3
   5. *where # is the timepoint (in hours) and Spp is the 3 letter species abbreviation (POR, MON, POC)*
1. For each tank, three random fragments will be chosen. For each fragment:
   1. Sanitize tools with 70% ethanol as needed and between each tank (every 3 fragments)
   2. First fragment ("P" fragment):
      1. Record plug number on datasheet
      2. Take picture on Canon Camera in RAW mode with color standard and ruler visible
      3. Clip coral off plug into whirlpak and flash freeze in mesh bag in LN2 dewar
   3. Second fragment ("R" fragment):
      1. Record plug number on datasheet
      2. Take picture on Canon Camera in RAW mode with color standard and ruler visible
      3. Clip off plug and then clip in half - nice part goes into PAXgene tube and other part goes to DNA/RNA shield tube
   4. Third fragment ("S" fragment):
      1. Record plug number on datasheet
      2. Take picture on Canon Camera in RAW mode with color standard and ruler visible
      3. Clip coral off plug into formalin fixative
2. Begin dark adaptation for 30 minutes when sampling is complete
3. Write down plug number from sheet onto each tube so each tube has redundant labelling
4. Move all PAXgene (LCM) and formalin tubes (spatial) to racks 4 ºC cold room on shaker organized by timepoint (shake 24 hours)
5. Move all DNA/RNA shield tubes to box in -80ºC (can be at 4ºC for a few hours first to let tissues lyse if desired)
6. Move all whirlpaks to mesh bag in -80ºC
7. After 30 minutes, PAM the 3 designated PAM fragments in each tank and record F, M, Y values and plug #
8. **24 hours later**: Wash fixatives
   1. This needs to be done in the hood, wearing a lab coat. Use the serilogical pipette labelled formalin/paxgene and 5mL serilogical pipettes. Can also use the 5mL pipette with 5mL pipette tubes (micropipette style)
   2. Prepare waste containers:
      1. Waste Bottle: PAXgene tissue fixative & PAXgene tissue stabilizer
      2. Waste Bag: PAXgene tissue fixative- & PAXgene tissue stabilizer-contaminated solids
      4. Waste Bottle: 4% Formaldehyde in Seawater & 70% Ethanol
      5. Waste Bag: 4% Formaldehyde in Seawater- & 70% Ethanol-contaminated solids
   3. PAXgene tissue fixative 5mL "R" tubes:
      1. Remove fixative from 5mL into labeled PAXgene tissue fixative waste bottle
      2. Replace with 4 mL of cold (4ºC) PAXgene tissue stabilizer (ethanol added). Close tube.
      3. Perform 1 wash - invert tube 3X and then remove the PAXgene tissue stabilizer into same waste bottle.
      4. Replace with fresh 4 mL of cold (4ºC) PAXgene tissue stabilizer (ethanol added). Close tube.
      5. Move tubes to designated box in 4ºC Flammable Fridge. Make sure box is labelled as containing tissue in PAXgene tissue stabilizer (70% ethanol, flammable!)
   4. Formalin 5mL "S" tubes:
      1. Remove fixative from 5mL into labeled formalin waste bottle
      2. Replace with 4 mL of cold (4ºC) 70% ethanol (made with RNAse/DNAse-free water). Close tube.
      3. Perform 1 wash - invert tube 3X and then remove the PAXgene tissue stabilizer into same waste bottle.
      4. Replace with fresh 4 mL of cold (4ºC) 70% ethanol (made with RNAse/DNAse-free water). Close tube.
      5. Move tubes to designated box in 4ºC Flammable Fridge. Make sure box is labelled as containing tissue in 70% ethanol(flammable!)

## Personell

1. Ideal situation
   1. Coral grabber: Retrieve corals from tank, read plug number to scribe, hand plug to photographer
   2. Photographer: Take picture on Canon Camera in RAW mode with color standard and ruler visible
   3. Scribe: Write down plug numbers and make sure everyone is sampling tanks in correct order
   4. Sampler #1: Prepare and close up whirlpaks & plunge into LN2, help sampler #2 with tubes
   5. Sampler #2: Clip all fragments off plugs into respective tubes
2. Two-person mode:
   1. Coral grabber/Photographer: Retrieve corals, read plug number to scribe, take picture
   2. Sampler/Scribe: Write down plug number, make sure tanks are being sampled in correct order, do all sampling tasks
